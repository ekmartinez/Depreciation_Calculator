# Depreciation Calculator
=====================================================

This C program calculates and displays the depreciation schedule of an asset over a specified number of periods. The user is prompted to enter the historical cost of the asset and the number of periods.

The program uses the straight-line method of depreciation, where the depreciation per period is calculated by dividing the historical cost by the number of periods. It then iterates through each period, subtracting the depreciation
from the original cost and updating the display.

**Features:**

* Supports calculation of depreciation for any asset with a specified historical cost
* Allows user to specify the number of periods over which the depreciation is calculated
* Displays the depreciation schedule in a clear and easy-to-read format

**Usage:**

1. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler (e.g. `gcc`).
2. Run the program by executing the compiled binary.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the historical cost of the asset and the number of periods.
4. The program will display the depreciation schedule for each period, showing the depreciation amount and the remaining cost.

**Limitations:**

* This program uses the straight-line method of depreciation, which may not be suitable for all assets or accounting scenarios.
* The program does not account for any salvage value or residual value of the asset at the end of its useful life.
